# Design-a-Digital-Lock-System-Using-Sequential-Logic
This project implements a secure digital lock system designed using sequential logic circuits in Verilog HDL. The system unlocks only when a predefined binary sequence is entered correctly. The design uses a finite state machine (FSM) approach, demonstrating practical concepts of state transitions and memory in digital electronics.
